#freeCodeCamp Portfolio

This directory contains projects that I completed as part of the freeCodeCamp.com curriculum.  I am currently working toward my Front End Development certificate, and these projects are made using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.  I also make use of the Jquery and Bootstrap libraries.
